# CSS Sprite Generator - CLI Tool

This project is a PHP command-line tool for generating CSS sprites from images in a directory. It offers several options for customization and supports recursive directory scanning.

## Features

- Concatenate images into a single sprite file.
- Generate a corresponding CSS file with sprite positions.
- Support for recursive directory scanning.
- Customizable output filenames for both sprite and CSS.

## Example Assets for Testing

To make testing easier for users who might not have images readily available or need inspiration, the project includes **compressed folders (ZIP files)** containing example images. These images can be used as templates or placeholders to quickly test the toolâ€™s functionality. Simply extract the contents of these ZIP files, and use the included images with the generator. This is particularly useful for exploring the tool's features without needing to source your own images.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **PHP** version 7.4 or higher.
- A terminal or command-line interface to execute the script.
